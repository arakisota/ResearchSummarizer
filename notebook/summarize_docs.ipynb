One solution to tackle this problem is the intrusion detection system\\n(IDS). The two main IDS strategies are signature-based and anomaly-based, which differ\\nin their detection mechanisms [ 8]. The signature-based strategy trains the system to ﬁnd\\nspeciﬁc anomalies while the anomaly-based strategy searches for any deviation from a\\npre-known normal activity. Generally, IDS investigates the network trafﬁc in an ICS and\\ntries to detect abnormal activities in the transmitting data packets. This strategy, known as\\nthe network intrusion detection system (NIDS), monitors the incoming data packets and\\nprevents suspicious data from intruding into the system. Many studies leveraged machine\\nlearning algorithms to train a NIDS model, which is responsible for detecting attacks in the\\nnetwork trafﬁc [ 9–11]. Although the NIDS effectively qualiﬁes and quantiﬁes attacks by\\nanalyzing the amount and types of attacks in the network ﬂow, its performance against\\nencrypted data packets, faked IP packets, and regular false positive alerts is not guaranteed.\\nFigure 1. ICS network architecture.\\nOn the other hand, the measurement intrusion detection system (MIDS) instead of\\nmonitoring the network trafﬁc, investigates suspicious activities in the system’s measure-\\nment data. As shown in Figure 1, the MIDS does not interact with the connections between\\nthe ICS levels, but directly inspect the measurement data in the system. This fault detection\\napproach can ﬁnd any deviation from normal performance caused by malicious activities\\nsuch as changing the sensors setpoints or injecting fake data measurements into the ICS\\nnetwork levels. Since, in an ICS, the SCADA system (Level II) collects the data from the\\nentire system, the MIDS can be embedded in this system’s level. In comparison to the\\nNIDS method, a few studies tried to use machine learning algorithms for training a fault\\ndetection model. Choi et al. [ 12] presented an IDS based on voltage measurement data to\\ndetect in-vehicle controller area network (CAN) intrusions using inimitable characteristics\\nof electrical signals. Their approach is well designed to detect bus-off attacks [ 13] and per-\\nforms very well to secure an in-vehicle CAN. However, relying on only one type of variable\\nto detect suspicious activities in the system caused a high rate of false positives in the IDS.\\nIn [14], Pan et al. introduced an IDS strategy leveraging features of signature-based and\\nspeciﬁcation-based detection methods which protects an electrical power transmission line\\nfrom attacks. They used data from relay, network security logs, and energy management\\nsystem (EMS) logs. Their method could accurately distinguish malicious activities from\\nnormal control operations.

[ 15]\\nproposed an attack detection model employing state vector estimation (SVE) to detect false\\ndata injection at the physical layer of a smart grid. They showed that the model performs\\naccurately on various IEEE test systems in detection of abnormal behaviors; however, it\\ncannot detect the stealthy malicious activities properly.\\nBasically, due to the difﬁculties in generating a labeled dataset, which indicates\\ndifferent types of attacks in an ICS, most studies apply a normal activity dataset for training\\nmachine learning models. Therefore, the MIDS could only compare a set of normal data\\nwith the incoming data and detect any deviation from the normal activity. This strategy\\nwould fail while a stealthy attack that imitates a normal behavior intrudes into the system.\\nA solution to tackle this problem is generating a labeled dataset that includes different\\ntypes of attacks to train a machine learning model that is capable of detecting malicious\\nstealthy activities in the system. But, building a labeled dataset consisting attack scenarios\\nmeans the system should tolerate a set of controlled attack injected to the system, that\\ncould lead to a system failure and irreparable damages. Nevertheless, it is possible to\\nsimulate the critical infrastructures of an ICS using a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) to prevent\\ndamaging the system. This approach could be sensible while the ICS is a vital infrastructure,\\nand the system’s security is dramatically signiﬁcant [ 16].

To this end, we develop an experimental setup in which we\\ncan evaluate the effectiveness of fault detection by monitoring the measurement data in an\\nICS. For this, we employ a power generation testbed whose sensors’ values are measured\\nover several days. Different scenarios of attacks are injected into the system to generate the\\nlabeled dataset.

The presence\\nof SCADA systems, especially in large-scale ICSs, helps deploy the MIDS without any\\nadditional devices; however, the main obstacle in practicing the MIDS is preparing a\\ncomprehensive dataset to train a machine learning model. Basically, building an attack\\ndataset for measured data means injecting a malfunction to the system and possibly\\nthe whole system’s failure. This could have dramatically high costs when the system is\\na critical large-scale ICS. Moreover, for each system’s environment, the dataset should\\nbe built separately, and it could be extremely expensive. Fortunately, in recent years,\\ndevelopment in processing units and computation power has helped to overcome this\\nproblem by introducing the HIL technique. This technique stimulates the critical parts of an\\nICS and injects attacks into the system without any threat to the existing system. Tackling\\nthe problem of building a dataset, including real-time attacks, provides a remarkable\\nopportunity for studying the MIDS.\\nIn this study, to investigate the MIDS’s efﬁciency in ICS fault detection, an electrical\\npower generation testbed is employed, which is wholly explained in Section 3. The inves-\\ntigation procedure includes pre-processing the data, ﬁtting supervised learning models,\\nand evaluating each model’s classiﬁcation accuracy.

Methodology\\nThe developed attack detection procedure is described in this section. First, the most\\nsigniﬁcant attacks in the ICSs are introduced; then, the approach to detect these attacks\\nis explained. As shown in Figure 2, after collecting the data, the most relevant features\\nare selected, and a trained ML model based on the corresponding features classiﬁes the\\noutput data.\\nFigure 2.

Attack Description\\nAnomaly detection consists of various domains, such as intrusion detection, fault de-\\ntection, and event detection in sensor networks. Any deviation from a normal performance\\ncould be considered an anomaly in an ICS. It could happen due to several reasons, includ-\\ning a malfunction in a system’s component, insider sabotage, or an intentional cyberattack.\\nIn this paper, the concept of anomaly detection based on the MIDS refers to fault detection\\nand intrusion detection. When a malfunction or insider sabotage occurs, the MIDS tries to\\ndetect faults in the system. In addition, when an attacker attempts to intrude in the system,\\nit is known as intrusion detection.\\nAnomaly detection in ICSs using the measured data captured by the SCADA system\\nhas the privilege of detecting any deviation from a normal activity even if the intrusion\\nis not recognized in the network layer by the NIDS. Evidently, due to a deviation from\\nthe system’s normal behavior, detecting a malfunction or a simple attack that directly\\nmanipulates the system’s measurement data would not be a challenging task for the MIDS.\\nOn the other hand, the main concern about the MIDS effectiveness is its performance in\\nthe detection of stealthy attacks. These kinds of attacks occur when an attacker manipu-\\nlates sensor measurements or control signals persistency by penetrating control networks\\nwithout being detected until the system crashes. Normally, attackers attempt to imitate the\\nsystem’s normal behavior to stay undetected. In this paper, not only the MIDS performance\\nin the detection of malfunctions is evaluated, but also a set of stealthy attacks are injected\\ninto the system to investigate the MIDS effectiveness in the detection of this type of attack.\\n2.2. Data Analyzing\\nThe problem of imbalanced datasets in IDS modeling is a critical issue. In machine\\nlearning modeling, particularly in classiﬁcation problems, having access to a balanced\\ndataset in the training stage has a signiﬁcant impact on the model’s performance. In the\\nMIDS, this problem comes from a large number of normal conditions compared to abnormal\\nactivities in the system logs.\\nTo handle the problem of imbalanced datasets, a multitude of techniques are intro-\\nduced, such as the threshold method, one-class learning, or cost-sensitive learning [ 22].\\nIn fact, all balancing methods are based on oversampling or undersampling approaches.\\nBrieﬂy, the undersampling method tries to decrease the number of instances from the ma-\\njority class; on the other hand, the oversampling method attempts to increase the number\\nof samples of the minority class. While undersampling has the risk of losing important\\ndata, oversampling puts the model at the stake of overﬁtting.\\nOne solution to tackle this problem is the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique\\n(SMOTE) method [ 23]. The SMOTE is a random oversampling approach that generates new\\ninstances using existing data from the rare classes. For this, any point from the minority\\nclass that smoothly moves an existing sample around its neighbors will be added to the\\ndataset until the dataset reaches a balanced condition. Therefore, this method by generating\\nnew samples (which are not exactly the same as the existing samples) makes it possible\\nto avoid the risk of overﬁtting problems [ 24]. In this paper, due to the imbalance in the\\nlabeled data, the SMOTE method is employed to normalize the dataset targeted data.\\nMoreover, the balanced dataset helps the normal and abnormal data be split equally during\\nthe procedure of building the train and test datasets. In this paper, the Stratiﬁed Shufﬂe\\nSplit (SSS) method is applied to divide the train and test data. The test data include 0.3 of\\nthe entire dataset, and the number of re-shufﬂing and splitting iterations is considered as 5.\\n2.3.

The goal of feature selection is to ﬁnd the most effective\\nfeatures that lead to training more accurate models and less computation time. Feature\\nselection techniques can be classiﬁed as ﬁlter, wrapper, embedded, and hybrid methods [ 25].\\nIn the ﬁlter method, correlation criteria are employed widely in machine learning problems.\\nCorrelation is a measure of the linear relationship between two or more parameters. In\\nfeature selection, the most correlated features with the target would be chosen to build\\nthe model. Moreover, those features should not show a high correlation with each other\\nto avoid using redundant data. Pearson correlation technique is one of the most useful\\ncriteria in feature selection, which can be described as\\nCorr (i) =cov(ai,b)√\\nvar(ai)∗var(b)(1)\\nwhere aiis the ith feature, bis the target label, and cov()andvar()represent the covariance\\nand the variance functions, respectively. Corr (i)also indicates the Pearson correlation tech-\\nnique, which shows the correlation between the ith feature and the corresponding target.\\nTo select the features with a high correlation with the target, we need to set a threshold\\nvalue for choosing the features with a higher correlation. Suppose that the selected features\\nare correlated to each other. In that case, we can drop the one with the lowest correlation to\\nthe target. In addition, the features that show a high correlation together can be uniﬁed.\\nTo do so, the correlation of the features, two by two, are calculated, and the most correlated\\nfeatures are nominated for removal.\\nMoreover, in the pre-processing step, the input data should be scaled. This could\\nresult in a sustainable learning process. In this paper, the MinMaxScaler is employed to\\nscale the features values. Equation (2) describes this function, where am\\niis the ith feature\\nfrom mth experiment, aminand amaxare the minimum and the maximum values of the\\nfeature among the experiments, respectively. In addition, am\\ni(scaled )indicates the scaled value\\nfor the ith feature of mth experiment.\\nam\\ni(scaled )=(am\\ni−amin)\\n(amax−amin)(2)\\n2.4. Machine Learning Models\\nSupervised anomaly detection in ICS generally uses normal activity data to build a\\npredictive model of normal class as well as anomaly class. Then, any unforeseen data are\\ncompared with the generated model to detect its class. Several algorithms are applied\\nin this study to train a machine learning model for detecting anomalies by the MIDS.\\nHaving access to a labeled dataset allows for applying supervised learning strategies by\\nconsidering two classes of attack and normal activities. In this study, the most accurate\\nsupervised learning algorithms are chosen that are k-nearest neighbors (KNN), decision\\ntree classiﬁer (DTC), and random forest (RF).\\n• The KNN algorithm uses data to classify unforeseen data points by measuring the\\ndistances from the neighbor points. This classiﬁcation method classiﬁes new data by\\nthe plurality vote of its kneighbors which are assigned to the most similar class.\\n• The decision tree classiﬁer uses a tree-like model of decisions and their possible\\noutcomes. Normally, a decision tree classiﬁer is used for discrete categorical tar-\\ngets, which, in this paper, the target is a binary variable that includes attack and\\nnormal situations.\\n• The random forest algorithm is a combination of tree classiﬁers. This classiﬁer tries to\\nmaximize the variance by injecting randomness in data selection and to minimize the\\nbias by increasing the tree depth to a maximum level.', metadata={'source': '/Users/sotaaraki/ResearchSummarizer/data/electronics-10-00407-v2.pdf', 'page': 5}),\n",

Model Evaluation Metrics\\nThe performance of algorithms in detecting anomalies in ICSs based on supervised\\nlearning is investigated by the following metrics.\\n• Confusion matrix: This measure is used to evaluate a classiﬁer’s performance consid-\\nering a pre-known set of labeled data. For each classiﬁer, a confusion matrix would\\nbe generated. In addition, sensitivity, speciﬁcity, precision, and F1-score metrics are\\ncalculated regarding this matrix. The sensitivity or recall metric shows the likelihood\\nof predicting true positive, while the speciﬁcity measures the true negative rate. In ad-\\ndition, the precision metric represents the accuracy of the positively predicted classes,\\nwhich are actually positive. The F1-Score shows the balance between sensitivity and\\nprecision. Finally, the accuracy of the model is measured by evaluating the trueness of\\nthe results. Figure 3 explains a confusion matrix and its associated metrics.\\n• Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve and area under the curve (AUC). The\\nROC is a graph that illustrates the performance of the classiﬁcation algorithm at all\\nclassiﬁcation thresholds and includes two parameters: true-positive and false-positive\\nrates. The ROC compares the classiﬁers’ performance among the whole range of class\\ndistributions and error costs. To compare the ROC curves, the area under the ROC\\ncurve is calculated, called the area under the curve (AUC) metric. More values of\\nAUC implies more accuracy in the model prediction [26].\\nFigure 3. Explanation of confusion matrix.

As shown in Figure 4, the testbed system has four primary processes,\\nincluding a turbine process, a water-treatment process, a boiler process, and a HIL sim-\\nulator. In the procedure of building the attack dataset, to protect the system from harm-\\nful damages of attacks, the HIL simulates the thermal power and the pumped-storage\\nhydropower generators.\\nThe boiler process, including four controllers (level controller, pressure controller,\\ntemperature controller, ﬂow-rate controller), is responsible for heating the pumped water\\nfrom the main water tank. The turbine process consists of a motor speed controller that\\nrotates a turbine. The water-treatment process has a level controller that manages the level\\ncontrol pump (LCP) and the level control valve (LCV) and is in charge of transferring water', metadata={'source': '/Users/sotaaraki/ResearchSummarizer/data/electronics-10-00407-v2.pdf', 'page': 6}),\n",

Dataset\\nThe dataset used in this paper is from a HIL-based augmented ICS security (HAI)\\navailable at [ 17]. The testbed dataset is built by collecting measurements of 59 sensors\\nevery second through four days. During these four days, 28 attacks are injected into the\\nsystem. These attacks are a combination of 14 process control loop (PCL) primitive attacks\\nwhich are affecting four points in the system: setpoints, process variables, control output,\\nand control parameters. The attacks are stealthy type and cannot be detected easily by the\\nconventional NIDS.\\nThe next section is devoted to the implementation of supervised machine learning\\nalgorithms on the proposed dataset. The following section illustrates the MIDS performance\\non fault detection, especially stealthy attacks.\\n4. Results and Discussion\\nThe proposed MIDS method based on a machine learning approach is tested on the\\nHAI dataset, and its performance in anomaly detection is evaluated. The machine learning\\nalgorithms are trained and tested by employing Python. The procedure of generating the\\nmodel is shown in Figure 2. In this paper, several classiﬁcation algorithms were examined,\\nand the most accurate ones were selected to be implemented on the MIDS model.\\nDue to the large number of measuring points in the dataset, the most important\\nfeatures are selected by employing a correlation metric. The feature selection process\\ncontains two steps. First, the most correlated features are identiﬁed and uniﬁed. In this\\nstep, from 59 features, 41 are selected. Then, among the residue features, the ones showing\\nthe most correlation with the target values are chosen, leading to 17 remaining features.\\nFigure 5 shows the correlation matrices during the feature selection process. It should\\nbe mentioned that Figure 5b is the correlation matrix after removing the most correlated\\nfeatures together, and Figure 5c is the correlation matrix after removing the least correlated\\nfeature with the target.\\nMostly, in the intrusion detection problems, the training datasets are suffering from\\nimbalance targeted data. This is because of the much lower duration of attack activities\\ncompared to the normal conditions. In the testbed dataset, less than 4% of the whole data\\nare associated with abnormal activities. This imbalance of data could affect the performance\\nevaluation of the trained models. The SMOTE method is employed to tackle this problem.\\nThis method helps to balance the dataset without a high risk of overﬁtting.

The unscaled data could cause signiﬁcant problems during the model training\\nprocedure, and lead to an unsustainable learning process. Therefore, the MinMaxScaler\\nfunction explained in Section 3 is used to scale the measurement data in an appropri-\\nate range.\\nAfter the pre-processing step, the dataset is ready to train a machine learning model.\\nIn this study, the supervised classiﬁcation models that are implemented on the dataset are\\nk-nearest neighbor (KNN), random forest (RF), and decision tree classiﬁer (DTC). These\\nalgorithms are chosen based on their effectiveness on this particular problem. Two major\\nfactors are considered in the evaluation of the algorithms’ performances. First, the accuracy\\nin classifying the targeted output. Second, the required time for ﬁtting and predicting\\nprocesses. For the ﬁrst factor, the confusion matrix is computed (Figure 7), and regarding\\nthis matrix, other metrics such as accuracy, precision, F1-score, speciﬁcity, and sensitivity\\nare calculated. More information related to the confusion matrix concept and its metrics is\\navailable at [ 29]. For the second factor, the computation time for ﬁtting the training dataset\\nand predicting the test dataset is captured.

This algorithm consumes the least time for generating the model, while the\\ndecision tree classiﬁer has the lowest prediction computing time. This mentions that a\\ntrade-off between accuracy and prediction time should be considered for a real-life problem.\\nMoreover, the KNN algorithm shows a lower accuracy in predicting the anomalies and\\nrequires a longer time for ﬁtting and predicting processes. The result implies that the MIDS\\ncan be a reliable solution for the anomaly detection problem. Applying measurement\\ndata from the SCADA system to detect attacks could be considered a protection layer in\\nICSs. While the NIDS can protect the network trafﬁc from malicious intrusions, the MIDS\\ncould improve the system’s reliability as the second layer of protection, especially against\\nstealthy attacks.\\nUsually, stealthy attacks that intrude into the ﬁeld level (level 0) of an ICS attempt\\nto conceal the state changes by imitating a normal behavior and deceiving the protection\\nsystems. Usually, building a dataset that includes stealthy attacks is a complicated process.\\nFor the ﬁrst time, by leveraging HIL systems, a real-life dataset containing stealthy attacks\\non sensor data measurements is provided. This dataset consists of actual data during\\nintrusion attacks that manipulate the control parameters.\\nThe ROC curve illustrated in Figure 8 indicates that the random forest algorithm has a\\nremarkable performance in detecting anomalies.

Conclusions\\nIn this paper, the classiﬁcation performance of the measurement intrusion detection\\nsystem is investigated and a remarkable outcome is concluded, especially on stealthy\\nattacks.

Because\\nthe MIDS is investigating the measurement data, it could detect deceptive behaviors in\\nthe system better than the NIDS. The HAI dataset, including actual data from a power\\ngeneration system, is applied to evaluate the MIDS performance in fault detection. The\\nresults show a very successful classiﬁcation employing the random forest algorithm in the\\nfault detection process with an accuracy of 99.76%.\\nNevertheless, although the MIDS can greatly detect anomalies, especially stealthy\\nattacks, it cannot prevent malicious intrusions in the layer of network trafﬁc. Indeed, the\\nMIDS could detect anomalies when they successfully deceive the NIDS by imitating a\\nnormal behavior in the system. Therefore, the MIDS cannot be a substitution of the NIDS;\\nhowever, it can be embedded as the second layer of protection in the critical infrastructure\\nof ICSs. By combining these two protection layers, if any malfunction in the system,\\nincluding insider’s sabotage, systems failure, stealthy attack, or network intrusion happens,\\nthe IDS could be sufﬁcient in detecting it successfully.\\nMoreover, this study leverages the supervised learning approach to build a machine\\nlearning model. The unsupervised learning methods are also a topic of interest for our\\nfuture works; however, their efﬁciencies in comparison with supervised learning models\\nshould be investigated. In the future, we would like to investigate unsupervised learning\\nalgorithms due to the fact that they don’t require labeled data for the model training step,\\nwhich leads to detecting new anomalies in the system.\\nAuthor Contributions: S.M. prepared an initial draft and overall structure of this research paper for\\nanomaly detection in industrial control based on measurement data and invited other authors to\\ncontribute and expand the research scope.
